# git-practice
A repository for students to practice using Git/Github

Instructions for students:
- Fork the repository into your own github account.
- Remove the erroneous commit (you will find it in the history). It was a mistake! It shouldn't appear in history anymore. *Hint: rebase --interactive*
- Make a file called `todo.txt`, add some tasks into it, and commit it.
- Add more tasks to the file and commit those too.
- Go back to the original `todo.txt` and make a new branch called `planB`. Add some tasks to the file and make a commit.
- Merge the two branches back together. Fix any merge conflicts.
- Make a pull request against my master branch.
